With the rapid advancements in computer vision and deep learning, image classification has become a prominent area of research and application. This project focuses on developing a robust and accurate image classifier specifically designed to distinguish between cats and dogs. The classifier utilizes Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), a class of deep neural networks known for their effectiveness in image-related tasks.

The dataset used for training and evaluation consists of a diverse collection of labeled cat and dog images, ensuring the model's ability to generalize across various breeds, poses, and backgrounds. Preprocessing techniques such as data augmentation and normalization are employed to enhance the model's ability to learn invariant features.
